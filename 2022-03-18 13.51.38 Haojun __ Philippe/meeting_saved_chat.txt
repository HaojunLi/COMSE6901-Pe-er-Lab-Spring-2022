	Args:
	        -----
	        C:
	            Float in (0,1]: Sparsity parameter. Higher C = less sparse.
	        d:
	            Float. Negative self-interaction size. If set to None/default, it will be computed automatically as sigma - sqrt(n * C) + 1.
	        sigma:
	            Float. Variance used to generate multivariate normal covariance matrix.
	        rho:
	            Float in [-1, 1]. Correlation term of covariance matrix. Higher rho = positive connectance = mutualism =
	            harder to stabilize. Lower rho = predator-prey--type relationships = easier to stabilize.

13:21:00 From  Philippe Chlenski  to  Everyone:
	ways to fix sigma:
13:21:08 From  Philippe Chlenski  to  Everyone:
	-distance between common ancestors
13:21:22 From  Philippe Chlenski  to  Everyone:
	-minimum pairwise distance
13:21:27 From  Philippe Chlenski  to  Everyone:
	-maximum pairwise distance
13:21:31 From  Philippe Chlenski  to  Everyone:
	-distance between random pair
13:24:25 From  Philippe Chlenski  to  Everyone:
	within cluster interaction (penalty) terms:
13:24:36 From  Philippe Chlenski  to  Everyone:
	-i think the safest approach is to use the MAXIMUM pairwise distance
13:24:57 From  Philippe Chlenski  to  Everyone:
	-alternatively: the sum of all distances may be important

	seaborn will do heatmaps with a tree

	for seaborn:
13:36:46 From  Philippe Chlenski  to  Everyone:
	input = interaction matrix AND phylogenetic tree
13:36:58 From  Philippe Chlenski  to  Everyone:
	output = heatmap of interaction matrix clustered by phylogenetic tree
13:37:24 From  Philippe Chlenski  to  Everyone:
	normal seaborn clustermap just uses a matrix and infers a tree; we want to override this and use a ground-truth tree instead
